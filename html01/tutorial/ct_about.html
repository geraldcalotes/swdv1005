    <p><strong>Curbside Thai </strong>brings the rich flavor of Thailand to 
    North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35 
    years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers 
    that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte 
    with our modern mobile food truck.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy 
    paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various 
    mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from 
    11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and 
    11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the 
    difference! If you can't get away from your desk, 
    <em>Curbside Thai </em>will deliver.
    </p>

    Contact us to cater your next party and experience 
    what <cite>Carolina Traveler </cite>calls the <q>finest Asian food 
    on or off the streets of Charlotte.</q>
